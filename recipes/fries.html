		    <h2> Description </h2>

		    <p>These homemade french fries are very easy to make, and a great way to kick up your burger platter.</p>

	        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
		    <ul>
			    <li>2 ½ pounds russet potatoes, peeled</li>
			    <li>1 cup vegetable oil for frying</li>
			    <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
			    <li>1 teaspoon garlic salt</li>
			    <li>1 teaspoon onion salt</li>
			    <li>4 slices American cheese</li>
			    <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
				<li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
				<li>½ cup water, or as needed</li>
		    </ul>
		    <h2> Steps</h2>
		    <ol>
				<br><li>Slice potatoes into French fries and place them into a large bowl of cold water to prevent them from turning brown.</li>
				<br><li>Heat oil in a heavy saucepan or large skillet to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
				<br><li>While the oil is heating, sift flour, garlic salt, onion salt, paprika, and salt into a large bowl. Gradually stir in enough water to make a slightly thick batter that can be drizzled from a spoon.</li>
				<br><li>Drain fries and pat dry; dip into the batter one at a time.</li>
				<br><li>Lower fries carefully into the hot oil in batches to prevent them from clumping together. Fry until golden brown and crispy on all sides, about 7 to 10 minutes.</li>
				<br><li>Drain fries on a paper towel-lined plate.</li>
				<br><li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
			</ol>
